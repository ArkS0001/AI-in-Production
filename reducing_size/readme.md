I reduced a Docker image size by 99.70%.

From a bloated 846 MB down to a lean 2.5 MB. 

How? This wasn't one magic trick, but a series of optimizations. The 5 biggest wins came from:

1. 𝗦𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗜𝗺𝗮𝗴𝗲: Moving from a full OS base image (like ubuntu) to a minimal one like alpine or a distroless image. This alone accounts for a massive reduction.

2. 𝗨𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝘀: Using one stage with the full Go toolchain to build the binary, and a second, clean stage to only copy the compiled artifact. This means you don't ship the entire build environment to production.


These two techniques will get you >80% of the way there. But to get the final 19.70%, you need to consolidate layers, perfect your '.dockerignore', and use analyzer tools.

Smaller images aren't just for show. They lead to faster deployments, lower storage costs, and a smaller attack surface.
