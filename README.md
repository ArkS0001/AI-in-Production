Step-by-step breakdown of the process in the post:

Technical Design Document (TDD)

Start with a proposal doc.

It describes system design, architecture, and integrations.

If stakeholders approve, it becomes the system design to follow.

Design Review

Senior Engineers heavily review (and sometimes shred) the doc.

Painful, but ensures issues are caught early.

Development Effort Kickoff

If review passes, dev teams expand documentation.

Each subsystem gets detailed documentation before coding begins.

Backlog + Sprint Planning

Devs + PMs + TPMs break the design into discrete tasks.

Tasks are prioritized into a sprint backlog.

Software Development (with AI Assist)

Devs finally start coding.

AI helps by writing tests first (Test Driven Development).

Then AI is used to help build out features.

Code Submission Review

Two-day approval process for merging into main branch.

AI helps review submissions.

Staging + Production

Code is tested in staging.

If stable, pushed to production.

ðŸ“ˆ They report a ~30% speed increase from idea â†’ production.
